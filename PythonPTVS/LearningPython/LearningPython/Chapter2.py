# Condensed information from the book on 'naming and using vairables'
# You should follow some rules when naming your variables in Python
# 1) Variable names can only contain numbers, letters and underscores, and can only start with a letter or number
# For Exmaple: myVariable (good) _myVariable(good) 2myVariable (won't compile)
# 2) You can't have spaves in variable names like most programming languages. Typically, a underscore would be used in place of a space.
# 3) Avoid using Python keywords for variables that Python uses to function such as the word print
# 4) Advice: you should have descriptive and short variable names
# Example: Name is better than n, student_name is better than s_n, name_length is better than length_of_persons_name


message = "Hello Python world!" #assign a message to the variable 'message'
print(message)

message = "Hello Python crash Course World!" # we re assigned the value of the 'message' variable and reprinted
print(message)
