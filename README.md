# Python Apps

My goal throughout this repository is to become proficient and knolwedgable with Python and GitHub. I will be doing all VCS operations through the Git Bash/Terminal, and use this repository primarily for Python. This repository will contain various scripts I write that may be useful to me, books/exercises I complete (authors and books will be cited, and most comments will be summarizations or direct quotes from authors), and other Python related programming entities. If there are any questions, or concerns, feel free to contact me directly.
